# Temperature_and_humidity_measurement
 
Objective is to measure Temperature and Humidity with the help of ESP32 with DHT11 Sensor using Arduino IDE.

The materials required are ESP32, DHT11, 10K ohm resistor, breadboard, jumper wires.

The DHT11 sensor is used to measure temperature and relative humidity. This sensor contain a chip that does analog to digital conversion and spit out a digital signal with the temperature and humidity. This makes it very easy to use with any microcontroller. The DHT11 has a smaller range and it’s less accurate. However, sensor readings can be requested for every second. It’s also a bit cheaper. It can measure a temperature range of 0 to 50 ºC and humidity range of 20 to 90. The operating voltage of DHT11 is 3 to 5.5V DC. 
ESP32 is a series of low cost, low-power system on chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.
Temperature that is sensed with the help of DHT11 sensor will be displayed on the serial monitor in Arduino IDE.
